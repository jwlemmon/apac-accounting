New code is for version 9.00.70, which is still under development. These files will be uploaded as each one is completed.

The current source is for Ver 8.15 (Apacsrc15.exe), which is available on Source Forge. I will transfer these as soon as possible.

Version 8.14 source has not been deleted (Apacsrc8.zip). 

The Manual that is currently available (not complete - BUSY WRITING A NEW ONE) (ApacManual-7.zip)

This version compiles and runs with Micro Focus COBOL. - A version for Open Cobol will be ready in a few months.

The print routines used in some of the programs need at least MF Object Cobol as it has the PRN calls available. If Windows controlled USB printers are not needed then this does not apply as all reports are available on LPT and COM printers without these routines.
The USB printers allow for Business LOGO'sto be printed. 

If anyone needs some Demo data, please let me know and I will upload it onto the site.

The system requires registration to run a full business and as it is at present will run in demo mode if not registered.

I am busy removing the registration code and if anyone wants to use the system, not in demo mode then the override password when initializing a new set of books is 918273.

I am currently analising and doing the necessary to get the system to run on OPEN COBOL.

The idea is to, after getting it running on Open COBOL to then make the changes to have a 100% GUI interface.

The manual is for version 7 of the system and this I will try to get up to date over the nexrt 6 months or so.

The idea is to have it runing on MF with a GUI interface as well. This will first be done for Windows and then for Linux, which hopefully will not be too difficult.

As I am the only person involved it would be nice if any of you would like to join the project as developers to assist.
